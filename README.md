# Chess ELO app - Beta v0.3.0.

As a chess player one thing I wanna know is how my ELO will change after a competition.
Well, thanks to my long experience playing chess, i've been playing since 2010, i can realize something: internet has shown us hundreads of chess tools but none of them are as useful as we want. 

As a result: that new project with big goals on it. I'll be developing a new chess ELO calculator with new features and useful tools. If u want to know more things about it, please suscribe to my GitHub repository and be ready to contribute ;)
